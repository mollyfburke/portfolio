                    <div>
                            <p>I am a junior studying at Northwestern University, pursuing a major in journalism and a minor in political science. I plan to pursue a career in journalism to enact necessary change in my communities and ensure that citizens have access to accurate information. Ever since my first introduction to journalism in 10th grade, I have known that I wanted to produce informative and enlightening media. <br></p>
                            <p>This past school year, while taking journalism classes at the Medill School of Journalism, I also worked at The Sacramento Bee. The publication allowed me to publish articles several times a week, teaching me the self-discipline of quickly producing quality work.  As a breaking news reporter, I wrote articles only a few minutes before publication in order to have the most current information, while ensuring that all the facts were accurate and the writing well done. <br></p>
                            <p>Additionally, in the Davis community, I have written for The Davis Enterprise. While covering stories ranging from new businesses in the area to Picnic Day festivities, I learned how to manage the fast-paced environment of a newsroom and balance it with the importance of accurate and informational news stories. <br></p>
                            <p>I am excited to continue covering the Sacramento area as a journalist. Having lived in Davis my entire life, I know how important the Northern California area and its communities are to their residents. I am  honored to be able to continue keeping citizens informed.<br></p>
