                <h3>Book of Dreams: Sacramento driving permit classes foster self-sufficiency for immigrants</h3>
                <h4>By Molly Burke</h4>
                <h5>Dec. 6, 2020</h5>   
                    <p>Since arriving here from Afghanistan three years ago, Salma Haidary, 26, has relied on her husband to drive her and her children wherever they need to go. Without a license, she can’t drive on her own to look for work and has to walk to the store no matter the weather.</p>
                    <p>“I want to get a job. I want to be working myself. I want to be helping my husband,” Haidary said.</p>
                    <p>She’s made strides toward that goal since finding Immigrant Integration & Empowerment, an organization founded last year to serve newly arrived immigrant families in the Sacramento area. It holds weekly classes for Haidary and others covering the California Department of Motor Vehicles handbook for driver’s permits.</p>
                    <p>Haidary wants to open an at-home child care center, after she studies child care at a college and learns to read and write in English.</p>
                    <p>Because most attendees do not speak English and often aren’t able to read or write in their native language, the classes cover the material in Dari. Among the lessons: understanding what different signs mean and what to do if an ambulance comes behind you.</p>
                    <p>The course, which has been taught four times before, is often taken several times by students before they feel prepared for their license tests. Instructor Marvah Shakib said that she has so far worked with 67 immigrants, 10 of whom have passed their driving tests.</p>
                    <p>Molly Milazzo, a board member of the organization, said many immigrants, especially women, have barriers to learning how to drive beyond the language challenge.</p>
                    <p>“They start out with a lot of headwinds. There’s not only the fact that a lot of newly arrived women from Afghanistan never learned to drive for numerous reasons, political, social, cultural, in their home country, but there’s also a lack of exposure,” Milazzo said.</p>
                    <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the weekly driving permit classes have been held over Zoom, led by Shakib, who is also an immigrant from Afghanistan. Few of the students have laptops or computers, so most have relied on using phones, which prevents them from fully interacting with the virtual course.</p>
                    <p>Other families involved in the II&E’s other services that support their transition into the Sacramento community don’t have access to any technology that will allow them to attend a class.</p>
                    <p>Haidary, for example, has missed the last two weeks of her driving permit classes due to a broken phone. With no laptop to connect to a Zoom course, she has fallen behind in her progress toward getting a driver’s license.</p>
                    <p>Milazzo is hoping that Book of Dreams readers can help to bridge the technology gap facing immigrants in Sacramento. The organization is aiming to raise about $6,500 to buy 25 new laptops for newly-arrived Afghan woman to attend the virtual driving permit classes.</p>
                    <p>To claim a tax deduction for 2020, donations must be postmarked by Dec. 31, 2020. All contributions are tax-deductible and none of the money received will be spent on administrative costs. Partial contributions are welcome on any item. In cases where more money is received than requested for a given need, the excess will be applied to meeting unfulfilled needs in this Book of Dreams. Funds donated in excess of needs listed in this book will fulfill wishes received but not published and will be donated to social service agencies benefiting children at risk. The Sacramento Bee has verified the accuracy of the facts in each of these cases and we believe them to be bona fide cases of need. However, The Bee makes no claim, implied or otherwise, concerning their validity beyond the statement of these facts.</p>
                    <p>Shakib, who volunteers her time to teach the class, believes the new technology could make a big difference in allowing more immigrants to learn to drive, a necessity for finding jobs and transporting family in the capital region. The organization, led completely by volunteers, mostly from Afghanistan, is trying to bridge the gap between newly-arrived families and their new Sacramento communities.</p>
                    <p>The board members and workers within Immigrant Integration & Empowerment lean on their own experiences when pursuing the group’s mission.</p>
                    <p>“I used to teach child development to moms and that is when I learned that when the women at home cannot drive, cannot help their husbands with the responsibilities, it puts a lot of pressure on the husband and it creates a lot of family problems between the wife and husband. One of the factors is not being self-sufficient,” Shakib said.</p>
                    <p>While many of the students in Shakib’s classes are women, immigrant men also come to the Zoom meeting to learn about the roadways. Mohammad Yousuf Yaqubi, 43, a father in Sacramento, has been going to the classes for a couple of months after he failed the permit test at the DMV twice.</p>
                    <p>Yaqubi, who cannot read or write in English or Dari, has been desperate to learn how to drive to be able to bring himself and his children to school and doctor’s appointments. He relies on family, friends and neighbors to drive him when they can, but whenever they are busy, he doesn’t have any way of getting places. Yaqubi now works for Apple and hopes, once he’s driving, to get there on his own.</p>
                    <p>With a car being so necessary for his children and for holding a job, Yaqubi was overjoyed to find the class offered by II&E.</p>
                    <p>“I didn’t know what to do because I needed to learn all of the driving laws in order to pass the test,” he said. “So, I am grateful that I have this opportunity to just learn. This class has given me courage and I have more confidence after learning the material in class that I can pass the test.”</p>
                    <p>Haidary, like Yaqubi, is impressed with what she has learned in the class, which she hopes to get back to soon. With a broken phone, however, and no laptop, technology is preventing her from attending.</p>
                    <p>“If I had my own money, I would go buy a laptop, but we would be really grateful to all who could help,” Haidary said.</p>

                <h3>“A constant state of crisis”</h3>
                <h4>By Molly Burke</h4>
                <h5>Community investment keeps up Enlace Chicago’s work through the pandemic</h5>   
                <p>Cesar Terrazas, a 21-year-old Little Village native, has spent this fall masked inside a room with other young adults, working on an old pair of Air Force Ones. He spends his days meticulously cleaning, restoring and polishing the sneakers to restore them to their original splendor.</p>
                <p>Terrazas is part of the sneaker restoration program at Enlace Chicago, where participants spend weeks transforming old donated sneakers into new pieces of artwork. The art program, forced to reduce its size with the pandemic, serves as a safe space away from street violence, allowing youth to focus on their work rather than the gangs and conflict that they encounter outside the center’s doors.</p>
                <p>With the COVID-19 pandemic, Enlace Chicago, an organization that helps residents with economic and social services in Little Village, has adjusted to safety precautions while still reaching the community. Like other organizations across the country, Enlace is facing significant challenges while trying to socially distance and reduce the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
                <p>While the public health crisis is ongoing, community issues are ever present and even exacerbated by the pandemic, creating a need for Enlace’s work to go on. Staff members are adjusting to the pandemic using virtual services, outdoor meet-ups and even small classes as they take risks to intervene in street violence among youth in Little Village, which has been an ongoing neighborhood crisis.</p>
                <p>“We’re still here. Yes, there’s challenges. Yes, we have to be really careful, but we also acknowledge that, and we consider ourselves like first responders,” Jesse Huerta, the violence intervention program manager said.</p>
                <p>Enlace Chicago relies heavily on in-person interactions, often using outreach to make their services known. Many residents have unreliable internet or lack technology to make virtual services possible, but the organization’s staff are continuing to work.</p>
                <p>“Just being active and being visible to the community if they need anything, to the guys out on the block, it’s been challenging but nevertheless we’re still out there,” Huerta said.</p>
                <p>With the closures and safety precautions that came with the coronavirus pandemic, youth intervention programs, including art programs, group activities, mentorship and counseling, were largely able to go on safely during the summer. Autumn and cold weather, however, has moved the programs back inside. Huerta explained that keeping enrollment numbers around 6 people per program session, to maintain proper social distancing, has forced difficult decisions.</p>
                <p>“The most difficult part of that is electing the five out of 20 that we know need the services, that we know need these distractions,” Huerta said.</p>
                <p>The organization has provided services for healthcare, food, education, legal help and mental health to Little Village residents since 2008, when the Little Village Community Development Corporation, founded in 1990, was renamed as Enlace Chicago.</p>
                <p>La Villita is a predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood, with 77 percent of the population identifying as such, and about a quarter of the population are undocumented immigrants. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the neighborhood hard, by crippling their booming retail economy; Little Village ordinarily relies on restaurants, shops, bakeries and street vendors for residents’ jobs, but the pandemic shut those down. Little Village is also facing high rates of illness alongside the rest of Cook County, which is nearing 300,000 positive COVID-19 cases with a test positivity rate near 16 percent.</p>
                <p>Even with the challenges brought by the pandemic, Little Village continues to encounter issues of street violence that they have faced for years.</p>
                <p>“Para ellos, nada cambió. Ellos siempre han vivido en estado de crisis,” Alicia Martinez, the violence prevention program manager at Enlace, said.</p>
                <p>For Terrazas, who has been participating in programs with Enlace since he was 14 years old, the support Enlace provides is too essential to stop for the coronavirus. Without support from the violence prevention department, he wouldn’t have been able to avoid the street violence that was a part of his life as a young teenager.</p>
                <p>“I used to only go home to shower and then go back into the streets [...] If I would’ve never met them, then I would be totally different. By now, I’m pretty sure I would be in a gang,” Terrazas said.</p>
                <p>When he was shot last year, staff at Enlace helped him get to his doctor and rehabilitation appointments, treating him to a meal out after. Terrazas was aided in finding healthcare despite having no insurance and continued to participate in violence prevention programs offered by Enlace.</p>
                <p>The violence prevention department, led by Martinez, a social worker who used to work with foster youth and families in Chicago, is centered around acknowledging and addressing mental health issues facing the neighborhood’s youth. Martinez feels a responsibility to end the school-to-prison in Little Village, by discussing trauma and mental health, while encouraging schools to reduce punitive measures.</p>
                <p>With a network of school-based counselors in four Little Village schools and street-based counselors around the neighborhood, Martinez’s programs provide one-on-one counseling for youth alongside a mentorship program.</p>
                <p>While school closures and social distancing have made meetings with on-campus counselors more difficult, some have gone out of their way to continue to connect with youth. Martinez said one counselor even shows up to McDonald’s wearing personal protective equipment to make sure teens can stop by to talk safely.</p>
                <p>Among these mentors is Little Village native Anthony Chappell, who works as a case manager for Enlace. Chappell got caught up in street violence as a teenager and ended up spending some time in jail before realizing he wanted to prevent others in La Villita from following the same path.</p>
                <p>“They’re good kids, they’re just sometimes stuck in bad situations. They go through so much and in this community, they’re forced to grow up too fast,” Chappell said.</p>
                <p>Chappell spends his days talking to youth on the phone, texting them, making video calls and meeting in person with masks to keep up with them, connecting teens with any services they need for education, healthcare, housing and job training. The pandemic hasn’t deterred Chappell from his work, who plans to continue connecting with participants no matter what.</p>

                <h3>“Ellos siempre han vivido en estado de crisis”</h3>
                <h4>By Molly Burke</h4>
                <h5>La inversión comunitaria mantiene el trabajo de Enlace Chicago durante la pandemia</h5>   
                <p>Cesar Terrazas, un nativo de La Villita de 21 años de edad, ha pasado este otoño enmascarado dentro de una habitación con otros jóvenes, trabajando en un viejo par de Air Force Ones. Pasa sus días limpiando meticulosamente, restorando y puliendo las zapatillas para devolverlas a su esplendor original.</p>
                <p>Terrazas forma parte del programa de restauración de zapatillas de deporte en Enlace Chicago, donde los participantes pasan semanas transformando las viejas zapatillas donadas en nuevas piezas de arte. El programa de arte, obligado a reducir su tamaño con la pandemia, sirve como un espacio seguro lejos de la violencia callejera, permitiendo a los jóvenes centrarse en su trabajo en lugar de las pandillas y el conflicto que encuentran fuera de las puertas del centro.</p>
                <p>Con la pandemia COVID-19, Enlace Chicago, una organización que ayuda a los residentes con servicios económicos y sociales en La Villita, se ha ajustado a las precauciones de seguridad mientras que todavía llega a la comunidad. Al igual que otras organizaciones en todo el país, Enlace se enfrenta a importantes desafíos mientras intenta distanciarse socialmente y reducir la propagación del coronavirus.</p>
                <p>Si bien la crisis de salud pública sigue en curso, los problemas comunitarios siempre están presentes e incluso se ven exacerbados por la pandemia, lo que crea la necesidad de que continúe el trabajo de Enlace. Los miembros del personal se están adaptando a la pandemia utilizando servicios virtuales, reuniones al aire libre e incluso clases pequeñas, ya que corren el riesgo de intervenir en la violencia callejera entre los jóvenes de La Villita, que ha sido una crisis de vecindad en curso.</p>
                <p>“Todavía estamos aquí. Sí, hay desafíos. Sí, tenemos que ser muy cuidadosos, pero también reconocemos eso, y nos consideramos como socorristas”, añadió Jesse Huerta, el gerente del programa de intervención de violencia en Enlace.</p>
                <p>Enlace Chicago depende en gran medida de las interacciones en persona, a menudo utilizando la extensión para asegurarse que otros conocen sus servicios. Muchos residentes tienen internet poco confiable o no tienen tecnología propia para hacer posibles los servicios virtuales, pero la organización sigue trabajando.</p>
                <p>“Solo estar activo y ser visible para la comunidad si necesitan algo, para los chicos que están en la cuadra, ha sido un desafío, pero sin embargo todavía estamos ahí afuera”, dijo Huerta.</p>
                <p>Con los cierres y las precauciones de seguridad que se dieron con la pandemia del coronavirus, los programas de intervención juvenil, incluyendo programas de arte, actividades grupales, tutoría y asesoramiento, pudieron continuar en gran medida con seguridad durante el verano. El otoño y el frío, sin embargo, han movido los programas de nuevo al interior. Huerta explicó que mantener el número de matrículas alrededor de 6 personas por sesión del programa, para mantener el distanciamiento social adecuado, ha forzado a tomar decisiones difíciles.</p>
                <p>“La parte más difícil de eso es elegir a los cinco de 20 que sabemos que necesitan los servicios, que sabemos que necesitan estas distracciones'', apuntó Huerta.</p>
                <p>La organización ha proporcionado servicios para la salud, la alimentación, la educación, la ayuda legal y la salud mental a los residentes de La Villita desde 2008, cuando la Little Village Community Development Corporation, fundada en 1990, fue renombrada como Enlace Chicago.</p>
                <p>La Villita es un barrio predominantemente mexico-americano, con el 77 por ciento de la población identificándose como tal, y alrededor de una cuarta parte de la población son inmigrantes indocumentados. La pandemia COVID-19 ha golpeado duramente al vecindario, al paralizar su floreciente economía minorista; Little Village normalmente depende de restaurantes, tiendas, panaderías y vendedores ambulantes para los empleos de los residentes, pero la pandemia los cerró. La Villita también se enfrenta a altas tasas de enfermedad junto con el resto del condado de Cook, que está cerca de 300.000 casos COVID-19 positivos con una tasa de positividad de prueba cercana al 16 por ciento.</p>
                <p>Incluso con los desafíos que plantea la pandemia, La Villita sigue encontrando problemas de violencia callejera que han enfrentado durante años.</p>
                <p>“Para ellos, nada cambió. Ellos siempre han vivido en estado de crisis”, explicó Alicia Martinez, directora del programa de prevención de la violencia en Enlace.</p>
                <p>Para Terrazas, quien ha participado en programas con Enlace desde que tenía 14 años, el apoyo que ofrece Enlace es demasiado necesario para parar por el coronavirus. Sin apoyo del departamento de la prevención de la violencia, él no podría evitar la violencia en las calles, que formó parte de su vida como adolesscente.</p>
                <p>“Solo me fui a casa para ducharme y luego volver a las calles [...] Si nunca los hubiera conocido, entonces sería totalmente diferente. Por ahora, estoy bastante seguro de que estaría en una pandilla”, explicó Terrazas de su juventud.</p>
                <p>Cuando fue baleado el año pasado, el personal de Enlace le ayudó a llegar a su médico y a las citas de rehabilitación, invitándolo a una comida después. Le ayudaron a encontrar atención médica a pesar de no tener seguro y su mamá recibió ayuda del personal mientras Terrazas todavía se estaba recuperando.</p>
                <p>El departamento de prevención de la violencia, dirigido por Martínez, un trabajador social que solía trabajar con jóvenes de crianza acogida y familias en Chicago, se centra en reconocer y abordar los problemas de salud mental que enfrentan los jóvenes del vecindario. Martinez siente la responsabilidad de terminar el programa de la escuela a la prisión en La Villita, discutiendo el trauma y la salud mental, al tiempo que anima a las escuelas a reducir las medidas punitivas.</p>
                <p>Con una red de consejeros escolares en cuatro escuelas de Little Village y consejeros ambulantes en todo el barrio, los programas de Martinez ofrecen asesoramiento individual para jóvenes junto con un programa de mentoría.</p>
                <p>Aunque las escuelas se cerraron y el distanciamiento social ha sido difícil para las reuniones con los consejeros, algunos han hecho todo lo posible para seguir conectándose con los jóvenes. Martínez dijo que un consejero incluso fue a McDonald 's con equipo de protección personal para asegurarse de que los adolescentes podían quedarse y hablar.</p>
                <p>Entre estos mentores se encuentra un nativo de La Villita, Anthony Chapppell, quien trabaja como administrador de casos por Enlace. Chappell se vio envuelto en la violencia callejera cuando era adolescente y terminó pasando algún tiempo en la cárcel antes de darse cuenta de que quería evitar que otros en La Villita sigan el mismo camino.</p>
                <p>“Son buenos niños, a veces están atrapados en malas situaciones. Pasan por tanto y en esta comunidad, se ven obligados a crecer demasiado rápido”, dijo Chappell.</p>
                <p>Chappell pasa sus días hablando con los jóvenes por teléfono, enviándoles mensajes de texto, haciendo videollamadas y reuniéndose en persona con máscaras para mantenerse al día con ellos, conectando a los adolescentes con cualquier servicio que necesiten para la educación, la atención médica, la vivienda y la formación laboral. La pandemia no ha disuadido a Chappell de su trabajo, que planea seguir conectándose con los participantes, no importa qué.</p>

                <h3>Hecky’s continues to serve ‘the sauce,’ even amid the pandemic</h3>
                <h4>By Molly Burke</h4>
                <h5>May 12, 2020</h5>   
                <p>For 37 years, Hecky Powell has brought good barbecue to Evanston. Now, amid the pandemic, lines continue to form outside of the famous establishment, with customers six feet apart and faces covered in masks.<br>
                    The pulled pork, chicken wings and famous barbecue sauce, all recipes from Powell’s mother, continue to draw customers in.<br>
                    Clarence Weaver, founder of the Black Business Consortium of Evanston North Shore, said the continued support is a testament to the work Powell has done for the community since opening his restaurant in 1983.<br>
                    “It’s not just a business that sells barbecue, but he actually is legendary in terms of what he provides in terms of leadership to the community,” said Weaver. “As a black business owner myself, we all look up to Hecky for what he’s done over the years.”<br>
                    For example, Hecky’s Barbecue offers Evanston Township High School students employment opportunities. In June of 2016, Powell founded the Work Ethic Program, designed to teach students a trade.<br>
                    Students apply to the program, which provides a paid summer internship, a tuition stipend, workplace training and mentoring opportunities. Powell believes the program is beneficial to both the students and businesses of the Evanston community.<br>
                    “I like working with people that really want to help themselves and make something out of themselves. I don’t care if it’s college, a trade or whatever,” Powell said.<br>
                    Employees at Hecky’s Barbecue have had to adjust to safety regulations, but have continued to work busy shifts. Powell said the business has been prosperous enough to continue to employ all workers.<br>
                    The restaurant has felt fortunate with its booming business and has given back by donating meals to homeless shelters, the fire department and hospital staff, he said.<br>
                    The shelter-in-place order and the coronavirus pandemic have caused decreased business for many other Evanston restaurants. Evanston Economic Development Manager Paul Zalmezak said most restaurants are operating at 30 percent of their peak revenue, even after shifting to delivery and pick-up services.<br>
                    While many other restaurants have struggled to adjust to social distancing guidelines, Hecky’s Barbecue has always offered delivery, pick-up and catering.<br>
                    Powell said he has noticed a slight change in the amount of customers, especially with many Northwestern students returning home. Despite the uncertainty, Powell said he makes sure to keep work at the barbecue fun.<br>
                    “We always have a good time, whether it’s working in the front line or the back line or the kitchen or out at an event,” catering director Aracely Rodriguez said. “It’s pretty fun.”<br>
                    Even when Powell was first working to open the restaurant decades ago,, getting up early in the morning, working on a low budget and spending long days doing various tasks for the barbecue, having fun was a critical component of the job.<br>
                    From picking-up the meat to cook to mopping the floors, Powell acted as the cook, the cleaner and the manager alongside his mother.<br>
                    “It wasn’t nothing easy, but it was rewarding and actually, I made it fun,” Powell said. “And I enjoyed it.”<br></p>

                <h3>Implementation of no-loan policy leads to changes in financial aid packages</h3>
                <h4>By Molly Burke</h4>
                <h5>Dec. 4, 2019</h5>   
                <p>Jenn Beardsley made the decision to attend Northwestern University to get out of the poverty cycle.<br>
                    With an annual cost of attendance totaling almost $79,000, this may not seem like the most logical decision. However, Beardsley, a freshman at SESP, was offered a generous financial aid package. In fact, the grants and scholarships she received were ultimately what pushed her to choose NU over a public school closer to her hometown of Roseville, California.<br>
                    Beardsley and about 46% of NU students have benefitted from Northwestern’s new no-loan policy, which reached its final implementation with the class of 2023. The policy guarantees that NU will provide grants and aid that will cover 100% of students’ demonstrated financial need without loans. <br>
                    Northwestern is not alone in adopting this policy. Other selective private schools with large endowments have done the same in an effort to attract more students from all income brackets.<br>
                    The director of Northwestern’s Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid, Phil Asbury, explained that the no-loan policy was discussed at NU when they felt a national push to make higher education more accessible to all.<br>
                    The no-loan policy, which costs Northwestern an additional $25 million, makes up 10% of the annual spending on financial aid, a significant increase. <br>
                    Professor Jesse Rothstein at University of California, Berkeley, and professor Cecilia E. Rouse at Princeton University conducted a study regarding the no-loan policy, following its implementation at an anonymous university. They found that while the policy brought in more minorities, it did not have a significant change on the wealth of the students matriculating.<br>
                    A greater change was shown to occur in the careers that students pursued following graduation. Rather than feeling pressured to take on a high-paying job in the private sector to pay off debt, more graduates worked in public service jobs, like teaching.<br>
                    The policy, while often unheard of by students, has faced some confusion when students receive their financial aid packages, as federal loans are still listed, though they are optional. Asbury explained that the loans are offered in addition to the grants, though the grants alone cover the demonstrated financial need. The loans are an optional, additional supplement.<br>
                    Beardsley, for whom financial aid was a large component of her college decision, originally rejected the loans in her package, as she was wary of taking on debt. However, her family realized that the price of student health insurance at Northwestern (NU-SHIP) would be a factor, as Beardsley’s current health insurance wouldn’t cover her.<br>
                    “We ended up having to take out a loan to cover health insurance because my health insurance expires the second I step out of my home state,” Beardsley said.<br>
                    Beardsley and her parents were extremely concerned with the long-term effect on their financial wellness when taking out the loans.<br>
                    “My parents are very much like if you can’t buy it in cash, don’t buy it, don’t touch it, don’t look at it,” Beardsley said.<br>
                    She was also confused about why she had to take out a loan when she thought that NU was trying to cover the costs without loans.<br> 
                    Asbury explained that many students feel this way because what they view as their own financial need is higher than the demonstrated financial need according to the Free Application for Student Financial Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile.<br>
                    Requiring the consultation of lengthy, complex tax forms, the FAFSA and CSS Profile often leave students feeling that their expected family contribution (EFC) is far higher than what their family can actually afford.<br>
                    School of Communications junior Nolan Robinson was worried that this would be the case with him. His anxiety was only amplified by the fact that, when working on the forms with his mom and sister, they didn’t understand the complicated tax language.<br>
                    Coming from a low-income family with three siblings, Robinson knew that he would need a significant amount of money to make Northwestern a possibility.<br>
                    “I was afraid that some wrong piece of information would show Northwestern that I don’t need as much as I actually do. My anxiety was so high until I finally got the financial aid package,” Robinson said.<br>
                    He ended up with a package that covered all of tuition, housing and meals, even including a small stipend. However, Robinson still faces significant financial burdens with everyday expenses, from going out to eat to buying new clothes to getting textbooks every quarter.<br>
                    “Whenever I plan classes for the following quarters, I’m very meticulous about it. What classes need books? How much are those books going to cost?” Robinson said.<br>
                    With these concerns about other expenses in mind, Robinson knows that the loans offered to him in his financial aid package could help him out in the short-term and alleviate some of his stress, but he chooses not to take on debt for long-term benefits.<br>
                    “I know I am going to have to pay it back. I don’t like to worry about things. I just want to focus on school,” Robinson said.<br>
                    Weinberg freshman Clayton Miles was also offered a generous financial aid package but felt that he had no choice but to accept the loans offered to him. Miles is concerned that his debt, currently about $5,000, will continue to grow every year and add to academic stress.<br>
                    As more elite private universities implement similar policies, the average loan balance among these students decreases significantly. <br>
                    However, the policy certainly does not guarantee graduation without debt. Rouse explained that the varied methods by which schools determine your financial aid can play a large part in how much debt students take on.<br>
                    For Miles, the discrepancy between what he was given and what he can afford is a stressor.<br>
                    “It might just keep building. By taking out loans I feel pressure to study something or, when I leave, get a decent job so that I can actually pay it off,” Miles said.<br></p>

                <h3>Students with disabilities prepare for life after high school</h3>
                <h4>By Molly Burke and Claire Stevens</h4>
                <h5>June 19, 2019</h5>
                <h6>After high school, intellectually and developmentally disabled students can have a challenging time adapting. Whatever pathway they take — community college, a career or an inclusive four-year programs—these are people with a lot to contribute.</h6>
                <p> Disability advocate Beth Foraker calls it “falling off the cliff.”<br>
                    Though the end of high school is a difficult transition for many students, for students who have had the support of a special education program throughout high school, the transition can be especially challenging.<br>
                    Beth has four children, including Patrick, a son with Down syndrome. When her son approached the end of his time at Da Vinci High School, she remembers approaching the impending ending of high school with concern. Patrick had to find his next step, whether it be working, community college or something else.<br>
                    Patrick Foraker: An inclusive environment<br>
                    When Beth Foraker’s third child, Patrick, was born with Down syndrome, she believed that she and her family would be isolated for the rest of their lives.<br>
                    “I had this comfort that he was exactly as he was supposed be and I didn’t see him as broken […] I wasn’t sad about that.” Instead, it was the “instant separateness” that Beth felt from the world that saddened her.<br>
                    Patrick’s early days were filled with health problems. He had open heart surgery at only nine weeks old and suffered from leukemia as a preschooler.<br>
                    Beth’s older daughter attended Davis Community Church Nursery School (DCCNS), and Beth was shocked when a teacher at DCCNS asked her to consider bringing Patrick to the school when he was old enough. She had feared no preschool would take Patrick.<br>
                    At DCCNS, Beth observed Patrick mimicking his peers and being able to have the regular preschool experience, mixing playtime and academics.<br>
                    When he was also offered a spot in a special education preschool, funded by the state with other students who had intellectual and developmental disabilities, Beth and her husband decided to split his time between the special preschool and DCCNS.<br>
                    The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates that a child must be placed in the least restrictive environment. Because Patrick had already been involved in an inclusive preschool, it was clear he could continue to be included in preschool.<br>
                    For Beth, the inclusive environment at DCCNS and, later, St. James Elementary, was key for Patrick.<br>
                    “We have a deficit mindset for people with disabilities and that is pervasive in education,” Beth said. She found that when Patrick had high expectations set for him, he was able to achieve them. At St. James,  he had support from a classroom aide to help him reach these expectations.<br>
                    Patrick continued at St. James until eighth grade when he was told he would not be able to follow his brother and attend Jesuit High School. This was especially difficult for Beth as she knew other students who had performed lower than Patrick in his class who went to Jesuit.<br>
                    Beth describes Patrick as a violet, while most people are daisies. “He’s rare. He needs a little more tending. Not everyone knows how to take care of a violet. But he’s a violet living in a daisy world.”<br>
                    Though it may be a daisy world, “he has no interest in being a daisy. None of us who love him want him to be a daisy. We’re really happy he’s a violet.” Still, he was given tests meant for ‘daisies,’ that he’s never going to do well on.<br>
                    “I know he is a violet,” Beth said. She’d prefer to instead focus on figuring out how to help him live  in a daisy world.<br>
                    Instead of going to Jesuit, Patrick continued on to Holmes Junior High School and then Da Vinci High School,  where he graduated in 2018.<br>
                    Ty Motekaitis: Difficulties with employment, housing<br>
                    Ty Motekaitis, a 2005 Davis High graduate, was in the special education program at DHS. After graduation, he spent a few years at Sacramento City College. “I never got to finish it, but it’s still a great place,” Motekaitis said. Then, Motekaitis wanted to live on his own and get a job.<br>
                    “We didn’t do the government programs; we just basically tried to get him in as a normal person,” said Daniela Camarra, Motekaitis’ mother.<br>
                    Motekaitis struggled to find both housing and employment. He took part in a program to provide disabled people jobs working in a cafeteria, though he was paid far less than minimum wage. Camarra was furious upon finding out how little he was paid and eventually the program agreed to meet the minimum wage, though they cut his hours.<br>
                    “They were paid $2.38 an hour. I’m not even kidding you. I questioned it from the start. Like, how are they not making minimum wage?” Camarra said.<br>
                    His mother would try to rent apartments on his behalf, but upon disclosing his special needs, she said landlords often made excuses to deny occupancy.<br>
                    Motekaitis eventually began working while living with his mother on her farm outside Davis.<br>
                    “He’s the best roommate too. So clean, ridiculously clean. He’s a good human being, But just watching [him], no one wants to give him a chance,” Camarra said.<br>
                    Immediately following his move from high school, Motekaitis lost the social aspect of school and sports.<br>
                    “That was a tough transition to tell to Ty, ‘you can’t go to this program anymore,’ you know?” Camarra said.<br>
                    However, he soon joined two sports at Sac City, allowing him to have a more social environment than the classrooms.<br>
                    When Motekaitis left Sac City, he also left the teams, and relied on events like anime viewings at UC Davis for social opportunities. Additionally, he worked with his father, UCD swimming coach Pete Motekaitis, to mentor other students with disabilities.<br>
                    However, Camarra believes that DHS did not prepare her son well enough for life following high school.<br>
                    “Davis is amazing in protecting you. I don’t think Davis is amazing in applying super assistance,” Camarra said.<br>
                    DHS has developed many programs since Motekaitis’ time at DHS, like the Workability program, classes specifically designed to prepare students for life after high school.<br>
                    DHS takes steps to ease transition<br>
                    In 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 19.1 percent of the disabled population is employed, compared to 65.9 percent of the non-disabled population. These statistics, along with the end of involvement in a special education program can make the end of high school an even tougher transition for students with disabilities.<br>
                    Stephen Smyte, the DHS football coach and a special education teacher, knows that the transition is very difficult, but believes that the Workability Program can help.<br>
                    Workability places students with disabilities in community jobs after they go through the typical application process of creating a resume and an interview. They work the jobs as any other employee would, though they have the support of the program at the high school to help them with any problems they may encounter.<br>
                    The special education department also offers classes that help with career and interpersonal skills, in an attempt to prepare students for post-secondary life.<br>
                    Smyte also believes that the current emphasis on extracurricular involvement at DHS really helps special ed students develop social skills that will help them throughout their lives. According to the most recent review by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges accreditation process, 83 percent of special ed students at DHS are involved in non-academic activities like sports, clubs, arts and music.<br>
                    Additionally, Debbie Press, who works on the workability program, checks in on students during their first year out of high school to see what they’re doing and refer them to an agencies that may help them.<br>
                    “We ask them, ‘are they working? Are they going to school? Do they need help with anything?’” Press said.<br>
                    Smyte believes that the right path for each student following DHS is different, and wants to support students no matter what they and their family choose.<br>
                    Andre Clark: Staying close to home<br>
                    Andre Clark, a 2018 DHS graduate, went through special education courses and support during his time in high school. Upon graduation, Clark did not go away to school, but rather stayed nearby and now attends Sacramento City College.<br>
                    While his daily life is similar to what it was like at DHS, Clark felt that the transition from high school to college “was rough.”<br>
                    “College can be stressful and upsetting at some times because people there are kind of different from high school,” Clark said.<br>
                    Though the change from a structured and supportive social setting in high school to the more independent one in college was difficult, Clark found friends through involvement in clubs. As an ambassador for the LGBT club, he works to help and support those who identify as gay, lesbian, transgender or bisexual.<br>
                    Additionally, Clark continues with Best Buddies, a club focused on promoting inclusion for students with disabilities that he also participated in at DHS. Once he joined the college-level Best Buddies, Clark noticed an improvement in his social life at Sacramento City College.<br>
                    Analeah Elohim: Pursuing passion<br>
                    Senior Analeah Elohim makes her own jewelry and sells the wares to fellow students at DHS. While unsure of what she will do next year, she is exploring career options related to her craft-making.<br>
                    Patrick Foraker: “The cliff”<br>
                    Beth Foraker wanted social opportunities for her son, too, as well as academic growth. She poured hours upon hours of research into looking into what Patrick’s next step would be. She wanted to be sure they were pursuing a path he was interested in, not just something she pushed him into.<br>
                    When Beth toured a special education program at George Mason University with Patrick she knew this was somewhere he wanted to be when at the end of a long day he was pushing to go to dinner with other students.<br>
                    Patrick’s father John Foraker was still unsure about sending his son to a program in Virginia, believing that it might be best for Patrick to keep him closer to home. However, when John returned to see the program for himself, he broke down in tears seeing Patrick participating and being fully included at the preview day, and knew the program would be perfect for his son.<br>
                    At GMU, Patrick lives in an integrated dorm with two other students in the Learning Into Future Environments (LIFE) Program. He also lives with one George Mason student who is not a part of the Mason LIFE program.<br>
                    In addition to inclusive living, Patrick takes classes with Mason LIFE students as well as regular university courses. Counselors can help him find jobs and internships to explore his career interest of becoming a movie director.<br>
                    To Beth, this integrated living situation is one of the keys to creating an environment to support Patrick and other students with disabilities. Not only is Patrick able to have an academic environment, he is also integrated into a social environment and community.<br>
                    “Someone with an intellectual disability is socially isolated. They just really are,” Beth said. “If they’re embedded in the community for four years […] they can really form a network.”<br>
                    With her son thriving in the innovative program, Beth Foraker is now pushing for  UCD and universities all over the country to create four-year programs like George Mason’s.<br>
                    “You cannot tell me […] there’s not people with amazing talents that could be contributing amazing things to their communities,” Beth said.<br></p>
