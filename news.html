                <h3>‘One pill can kill you’: Sacramento-area authorities cite dangers of fetanyl-laced pills</h3>
                <h4>By Molly Burke</h4>
                <h5>Aug. 20, 2020</h5>   
                <p>U.S. Attorney McGregor Scott had a simple message at a news conference Thursday: “One pill can kill you,” Scott said, gesturing to a bag of fentanyl-laced pills to his left.<br>
                    Representatives from law enforcement agencies in the Sacramento region gathered Thursday for a news conference to warn the public about the dangers of fentanyl. Overdose deaths from the powerful narcotic have increased dramatically in the region.<br>
                    At 10 a.m., Scott began speaking in front of large images of fentanyl-laced pills outside the Robert T. Matsui United States Courthouse in Sacramento. The U.S. attorney said the drug, typically manufactured in China and trafficked through Mexico, is highly potent, 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine.<br>
                    It’s almost Memorial Day. Here’s what you can (and can’t) do over the holiday weekend. <br>
                    The proper medical use for fentanyl is for patients managing chronic pain, like terminal cancer patients, through a slow-release patch. However, fentanyl has proven to be a cheap, and lethal, option to lace in opioid pills.<br>
                    Many suffering from addiction who began with prescription pills turn to illicit drugs for cheaper, more available alternatives. Scott said people may think they are buying Percoset and actually end up with a deadly amount of fentanyl.<br>
                    Placer County’s fentanyl-related deaths increased from zero to six from 2018 to 2019. In Sacramento County, deaths increased from 14 to 25. In San Joaquin County, the numbers went from three to 11. In Solano County, deaths jumped from five to 16.<br>
                    “I can tell you that the numbers from 2020, once we have those final numbers, are going to be dramatically greater than they were in 2019,” Scott said.<br>
                    Scott, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California, held the event in conjunction with Dr. Aimee Moulin, a member of the Sacramento County Opioid Coalition; Drug Enforcement Agency Special Agent in Charge Daniel Comeaux; Federal Bureau of Investigations Special Agent in Charge Sean Ragan; Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge Tatum King and district attorneys from area counties.<br>
                    Moulin, a professor of emergency medicine at UC Davis, warned that while healthcare providers are occupied with the coronavirus, they are continuing to face another pandemic of substance abuse.<br>
                    “We know that social isolation and economic insecurity are a setup for substance abuse disorders,” Moulin said.<br>
                    The doctor emphasized that the stigma surrounding drug abuse is an obstacle for people reaching out for treatment, which is effective and necessary, as it is with other medical diseases.<br>
                    Moulin also said that having naloxone, a nasal spray that can reverse the effects of an overdose, on hand can save someone’s life.<br>
                    Scott introduced a three-pronged approach to fight the threat of fentanyl, including treatment, education and prosecution. He called on parents to take the time to talk to their children about the extreme danger fentanyl poses.<br>
                    While often marketed as pills of another substance, fentanyl-laced drugs are produced illegally by people without any medical or pharmaceutical training. A very slight increase in dosage could result in an overdose, due to the strength of the substance.<br>
                    Scott highlighted a case in Fresno County that resulted in a 30-year sentence for Darnell Pearson, who was convicted of selling cocaine laced with fentanyl. The batch of drugs resulted in the overdose deaths of two users and the overdoses of two survivors.<br>
                    Comeaux, of the DEA, warned those selling the drug that the profit was not worth the time they would face in prison if connected to an overdose.<br>
                    “We will come after you if you’re selling this poison in our area,” Comeaux said.<br>
                    El Dorado County District Attorney Vern Pierson criticized the more lenient punishments for drug crimes in the state of California, but expressed gratitude that partnerships with federal agencies allowed for harsher prison sentences for those convicted of selling fentanyl.<br>
                    Ragan, who represented Sacramento’s FBI field office, said the bureau is taking steps to prosecute anyone who traffics the substance. He also said the FBI is monitoring the dark web, investigating those who sell on illicit websites and working to close the virtual marketplaces.<br>
                    Pierson encouraged parents to warn children and teenagers who may idolize celebrities who have abused drugs. The DA named Demi Lovato and Los Angeles Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs, who died of an overdose in 2019, as potential role models children should be wary of imitating.<br>
                    “My message is simple. Don’t do it for fun. Don’t do it for recreation,” Comeaux said.<br>

                <h3>‘They didn’t deserve to die’: Sacramento community mourns death of 2 young Black women</h3>
                <h4>By Molly Sullivan and Molly Burke</h4>
                <h5>July 30, 2020</h5>   
                <p>Zarrie Allen was visiting a grave site with friends on July 20 when someone opened fire on the group and took off. Allen, just 18 years old and a prospective Sacramento State student, died at the scene.
                    In February, Taylor Blackwell was found dead in a south Sacramento hotel room. Her cause of death has still not been determined. She was 19.
                    Their deaths have become a rallying cry in the Black community for a stop to a wave of violence that has struck Sacramento. And more specifically, activists and community leaders say, their cases highlight the need to prioritize support for Black women.
                    It’s almost Memorial Day. Here’s what you can (and can’t) do over the holiday weekend
                    “If we are going to fight for dead Black men who are shot by the police, we better fight the same way when our Black women are killed,” community activist Berry Accius said. “I’m tired and sick when I see (women) are not our top priority. I am in fear because I have daughters of my own. And to know the possibility of another Black man could take down my own child, that doesn’t’ sit well.
                    “I will not give an excuse for the violence here in my community,” he said.
                    Christi Ketchum, founder of Sacramento Sister Circle, a network for Black women, especially those that have been victims of crime, said Black women and girls disproportionately are the victims of crime.
                    “That happens to Black women and girls all the time and we’ve never heard it on any major media,” she said. “The impact that it has is that they feel like they’re not important. They feel like nobody cares. ... We speak up and protest what happens to Black men but we don’t see that returned.”
                    “We have to send the message that it’s not OK to kill and harm Black women and girls,” Ketchum said. “We have to send that message. And that has to come from the community, it has to come from the media and it has to come from law enforcement.”
                    VIOLENT CRIME INCREASE IN SACRAMENTO
                    There have been 28 homicides in Sacramento County this year, up from 19 at this time last year. Shootings are up nearly 50%. The southern part of the county has become a particular hotbed for violence in what law enforcement has described as a prolonged gang conflict. Gun violence is on the rise within the city of Sacramento as well.
                    “We are seeing more innocent bystanders lose their lives,” said Sgt. Tess Deterding, Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman.
                    Allen was with a group of friends at Memorial Lawn Cemetery in south Sacramento when shots rang out. Sheriff’s investigators have said they do not think she was the intended target.
                    Community members held a candlelight vigil for Allen last week, calling for an end to the violence. They chanted “Justice for Zarrie Allen” and urged the people responsible for her killing to turn themselves in.
                    Blackwell was found dead in a hotel room at the WoodSpring Suites Hotel on Feb. 28. Five months later, her family still doesn’t know what happened to her.
                    On Monday, about 50 parents and youth gathered outside the hotel on La Mancha Way to bring awareness to Blackwell’s death. Her case had not been in the spotlight in Sacramento until Blackwell’s mother began posting her story on social media.
                    Some brought their children in strollers. Many wore T-shirts saying “to know Taylor is to love Taylor.” And young people danced and marched across the gated driveway to the hotel, waving at cars as they passed.
                    Blackwell, a student at Sierra College, had been on a date the night she died with a man she met on Instagram, said her mother, Chiffon Buckner. The man had been “aggressively pursuing her” and even showed up at her work once before.
                    She went to movies with him, came home and then went out again after midnight without telling anyone, Buckner said.
                    The next day, Buckner found out from a family friend that Blackwell was believed to be dead in a one-star hotel off Highway 99.
                    Buckner said detectives at the time wouldn’t allow her to see her daughter and told her Blackwell’s death was believed to be accidental. But when Buckner saw her daughter’s body for the first time nearly a month later at the funeral home, it was covered with injuries.
                    “I was assuming she had no bruises on her, but that wasn’t the case,” Buckner said, her voice shaking as she spoke. “When I saw her, she had a gash between her eyes on the bridge of her nose. Her lips were cracked and busted up. Her arms were so bruised up that we had to cover them. We had to go buy a sweater and a shawl to cover her arms. And nobody told me that she had bruises on her or any of that, so I wasn’t prepared for it.”
                    Sacramento Police Department spokesman Officer Karl Chan said Blackwell’s death is being investigated in conjunction with the Sacramento County Coroner’s Office, but has not yet been ruled a homicide.
                    CORONAVIRUS MEANS FEWER YOUTH SERVICES
                    At the vigil for Allen last week, Taylor McClure, a Black woman and Sacramento City College student, expressed anger at the lack of attention paid toward the deaths of Black women.
                    “I am a Black woman out here supporting Zarrie because I believe that this is happening way too often,” she said. “It’s not talked about when it comes to Black women.”
                    A vigil is held for 18-year-old Sacramento State student Zarrie Allen on Thursday, July 23, 2020, near Sacramento Memorial Lawn Cemetery, where she was shot and killed Monday. Allen may not have been the intended target, according to authorities. BY XAVIER MASCAREÑAS
                    McClure said she advised Black women to consider carrying arms to be able to defend themselves.
                    Meg White, a community member who was also concerned with the lack of attention toward the death of Black women, said she was willing to do anything in order to stop the violence.
                    “I am tired of asking the people in power to care about my life,” White said.
                    Other speakers expressed anger that they continue to lose people in the community, forcing them to gather at vigils rather than celebrations.
                    “If we don’t protect our Black women, we don’t have no Black community,” Accius said.
                    Accius, in part, credited the increase in violence to the interruption of youth programming caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    “A lot of these kids are stuck in stressful situations at home, and now they’re there more than ever,” he said. “They’re on social media more than ever and it’s become a more and more dangerous thing.”
                    Prior to the pandemic, community members had successfully worked for years to develop an infrastructure of youth programs to help curb violence and give kids opportunities to work, make new friends and develop positive goals.
                    The success of those programs, along with funding and support from the city, was recognized earlier this year when Sacramento celebrated two years without a single youth homicide. In 2017, Sacramento’s teens were twice as likely to be killed by homicide than the general population, a Sacramento Bee analysis at the time found.
                    “(In programs), when you take young people out of their comfort zone, you can have youth together who are not usually together in a non-violent setting,” Accius said. “You can have them in a place where they have to work together to come up with a solution. You can’t’ do that on Zoom.”
                    “Now you have young people who have a lot of time on their hands,” he said. “You can’t monitor them like you used to . . . and it plays a huge part.”</p>

                <h3>Sacramento’s ‘spreading of love’ helps provide frontline workers with equipment</h3>
                <h4>By Molly Burke</h4>
                <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>   
                <p>Faced with patients on ventilators and seemingly endless treatments, Selena Srabian, an ICU nurse at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, easily finds herself getting stressed.<br>
                    Knowing healthcare workers nationwide are in need of personal protective equipment, in addition to a morale boost, Srabian and her sister, Anna Ryan, an emergency department nurse at Sutter Medical Center in Sacramento, started Protect with Heart.<br>
                    The group makes scrub hats with the goal of protecting frontline workers, while bringing them together. The sisters partnered with Sacramento artist Tim Collom, who used a heart print as the design on the hats. The project is funded by donations and purchases of Collom’s custom print, all of the proceeds of which go to the project.<br>
                    When the pandemic began, Srabian and Ryan noticed that among the shortages of PPE was a lack of scrub hats. While in the past they were worn only during certain occasions, COVID-19 has required extra precautions like the head coverings.<br>
                    By Sunday evening, Protect with Heart raised about $27,000, both through purchases and donations, to make scrub hats, which cost a little of $10 each to produce. The project will ship the hats to hospitals in need.<br>
                    While the project has been in the works since March, figuring out how to get the print on fabric, working out the details of the hat’s design and waiting for the manufacturer to reopen took time. The production of the hats began only a week ago.<br>
                    Srabian, Ryan and Collom are excited to pick up the first box of about 1,000 hats from their manufacturer in San Francisco later this week. <br>
                    Srabian and Ryan were able to pull together the production with the help of their company, Annie and Isabel. The nurses started the designer hospital gown company in 2010 and were able to use their manufacturer to produce the scrub hats.<br>
                    The choice to make hats was out of practicality. Without hospital-grade production, masks and gowns would be useless to healthcare workers. The sisters first started making hats from gown scraps at Annie and Isabel, giving them out to coworkers and friends.<br>
                    “Everyone at work wanted more. That’s kind of part of where it came up in our heads like, ‘Maybe we should do this. It’s bringing so much joy to our coworkers on the front lines,’” Ryan said. <br>
                    Protect with Heart’s current goal is to raise $50,000 to make close to 5,000 scrub hats, but they would be blown away if they could make more. The project also aims to ship boxes nationwide to hospitals hard hit by the pandemic.<br>
                    Nancy Lipsitz, a doctor and wife of David Langer, a neurologist who stars in Netflix docuseries “Lenox Hill,” donated money to the project and scrub hats will be sent to her hospital and to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York.<br>
                    Big Heart donors can sponsor an entire box of hats with a $500 donation, allowing them to include a personalized note.<br>
                    Having already made it past halfway to their goal, the Srabian, Ryan and Collom are amazed by the support shown by the community.<br>
                    “We’re super excited for people to start wearing it because then we can show everyone who has been supporting us how much it means to people,” Ryan said.<br>
                    Collom has experience with a similar fundraiser using his prints. In 2018, he donated over $150,000 in proceeds from a print of California to support firefighters during a destructive wildfire season.<br>
                    The artist hopes his heart pattern will make its way on scrub hats all over the nation.<br>
                    “Ultimately, I just want want to do whatever we can to make as much money for this cause as possible,” Collom said.<br>
                    Those interested in donating or buying a print from Protect with Heart can go to their website, protectwithheart.com.<br>
                    “It’s a spreading of love, not only from us, as healthcare workers, to our colleagues, but also from the community,” Ryan said.<br>

                <h3>D202 board approves 2021 budget amid pandemic concerns</h3>
                <h4>By Molly Burke</h4>
                <h5>Sept. 22, 2020</h5>   
                <p>The Evanston Township High School/District 202 school board approved its budget for the 2021 fiscal year at its Monday meeting, factoring in lost revenues and increased expenses related to COVID-19.<br>
                    The budget largely funds teachers’ salaries and benefits, with 68 percent of the operating expenditures allotted to that category, the district’s chief financial officer, Mary Rodino, said. The board also discussed the responsibilities of student resource officers on campus and related consequences.<br>
                    While remote learning and lost revenue have forced some personnel lay-offs, D202 Superintendent Eric Witherspoon said the district has focused on repurposing staff in new roles.<br>
                    Over 30 staff members have shifted into a new role of managing caseloads of students, checking in daily with them and working with their teachers to foster relationships despite remote learning challenges.<br>
                    Staff have also taken on the duty of book and supply distribution, delivery and collection that continues throughout the year as units change and new supplies are required.<br>
                    While there have been some reductions in revenue and concerns about future decreases in evidence-based funding from the state, the district’s final budget was balanced and didn’t “dip into the rainy day fund,” Witherspoon said.<br>
                    Rodino presented possible outcomes of recovery of funds over the next four years, ranging from slow to rapid responses and leaving different amounts in the school’s financial reserves. The board agreed that D202 was faring better than many other districts across the nation.<br>
                    “All those years of being so thoughtful and so careful about our budget and making sure that we were prepared and that our funds were solid, it will help us weather this storm a little bit,” school board president Pat Savage-Williams said.<br>
                    The final budget for the 2021 fiscal year totaled $91.4 million for all funds — 1 percent increase from the fiscal year 2020 budget. The approved budget also incorporated a $1.4 million decrease in funding from the tentative budget proposed at a previous school board meeting in June.<br>
                    While budgets often have slight reallocations throughout most fiscal years, Rodino said any changes in instruction to become hybrid or any other significant pandemic-related changes would mean the board would have to revisit and revise the plan.<br>
                    The board also discussed the role of school resource officers at ETHS, with many board members voicing concerns that while individual officers have been satisfactory, the system of policing could be traumatic to students.<br>
                    For those who have had negative experiences with police outside school, seeing uniformed officers in ETHS might be distressing, school board vice president Monique Parsons explained.<br>
                    “I have to think about that experience that that child is having or that student is having when they see an officer walking down the hallway that resembles that officer that just stopped their father weeks ago,” Parsons said.<br>
                    The discussion of school resource officers and other police reforms is also happening at the city level in Evanston, largely fueled by calls to defund police amid protests this spring and summer. For the district, the next step will be consideration and reform of discipline policies and practices by a committee.<br></p>

                <h3>Zombies invade Evanston for sixth-annual scramble</h3>
                <h4>By Molly Burke</h4>
                <h5>Nov. 3, 2019</h5>   
                <p>While Halloween may have ended last Thursday, spooky season didn’t.<br>
                    Evanston hosted its sixth annual Zombie Scramble on Saturday, where families and children run from “zombies.” The zombies, volunteers from Evanston and Northwestern, dressed in ripped and bloody clothes with their faces covered in matching makeup.<br>
                    The participants, wearing flags hanging from a belt around their waist that protected them from zombie attacks, traversed the 1.6-mile course along the Ladd Arboretum in west Evanston. The run featured alternating “safe zones” and “infected zones,” where zombies hid behind trees, waiting to chase the children. Zombies tried to pull the flags off of the belts, similar to flag football, while participants try to keep their flags, which represent their “lives.”<br>
                    Michelle Tompkins, a program coordinator for the city’s Parks, Recreation and Community Services Department, started the event six years ago. She envisioned a community-building event similar to a zombie obstacle course in her hometown.<br>
                    “It was a lot more physical so they did things like climb fences and move tires and things like that, but they did that while they were chased by zombies,” Tompkins said. “The thing that attracted me to it was the community that it built and just the number of people that it took for the event to be successful.”<br>
                    The event relies heavily on volunteers, particularly from NU. Slivka Residential College and the Sigma Nu fraternity have been sending volunteers every year since the event started.<br>
                    Among the volunteers was Weinberg sophomore Noah Scantlebury, who came with Sigma Nu.<br>
                    “We wanted to come out here and have a good time while giving back to the community,” Scantlebury said. “One of the biggest things that brought people was just the concept of being a zombie and chasing people around. It seemed kind of fun.” <br>
                    Another fraternity, Delta Chi, sent a large crew of volunteers this year. The Delta Chi members served as a zombie relief crew, who were dressed as zombies and alternate with other groups to let them come inside for a break from the cold weather. <br>
                    Jaime Berkovich, a McCormick first-year, came to get points for Ayers Residential College that will allow him to live in the dorm next year. He was working the final infected zone, trying to pull off the remaining flags before the runners crossed the finish line.<br>
                    “The kids are faster than I expected and I need to try harder,” Berkovich said. “It’s a good way to keep warm because it is pretty cold. That’s one downside; the people here are pretty chilly.”<br>
                    Berkovich said the event was an enjoyable volunteering opportunity, as he got to dress up and run around to stay warm.<br>
                    With over 900 participants registered prior to the event, Tompkins has been happy with the growth of the event since its beginning, when much fewer participated. She said people have been calling trying to get even younger children allowed into the event, which currently allows participants 8 years or older.<br>
                    “It’s becoming one of those community events that people look forward to and can’t wait to get to the point that they can participate, which is exactly what I wanted,” Tompkins said. “I wanted something that people would look forward to each year that was a little bit different than a traditional haunted house or something like that.”<br></p>
