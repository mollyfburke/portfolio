                    <h4>Community investment keeps up Enlace Chicago's work through the pandemic</h4>
                    <h3>By Molly Burke</h3>
                    <p>Cesar Terrazas, a 21-year-old Little Village native, has spent this fall masked inside a room with other young adults, working on an old pair of Air Force Ones. He spends his days meticulously cleaning, restoring and polishing the sneakers to restore them to their original splendor.</p>
                    <p>Terrazas is part of the sneaker restoration program at Enlace Chicago, where participants spend weeks transforming old donated sneakers into new pieces of artwork. The art program, forced to reduce its size with the pandemic, serves as a safe space away from street violence, allowing youth to focus on their work rather than the gangs and conflict that they encounter outside the center's doors.</p>
                    <p>With the COVID-19 pandemic, Enlace Chicago, an organization that helps residents with economic and social services in Little Village, has adjusted to safety precautions while still reaching the community. Like other organizations across the country, Enlace is facing significant challenges while trying to socially distance and reduce the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
                    <p>While the public health crisis is ongoing, community issues are ever present and even exacerbated by the pandemic, creating a need for Enlace's work to go on. Staff members are adjusting to the pandemic using virtual services, outdoor meet-ups and even small classes as they take risks to intervene in street violence among youth in Little Village, which has been an ongoing neighborhood crisis.</p>
                    <p>"We're still here. Yes, there's challenges. Yes, we have to be really careful, but we also acknowledge that, and we consider ourselves like first responders," Jesse Huerta, the violence intervention program manager said.</p>
                    <p>Enlace Chicago relies heavily on in-person interactions, often using outreach to make their services known. Many residents have unreliable internet or lack technology to make virtual services possible, but the organization's staff are continuing to work.</p>
                    <p>"Just being active and being visible to the community if they need anything, to the guys out on the block, it's been challenging but nevertheless we're still out there," Huerta said.</p>
                    <p>With the closures and safety precautions that came with the coronavirus pandemic, youth intervention programs, including art programs, group activities, mentorship and counseling, were largely able to go on safely during the summer. Autumn and cold weather, however, has moved the programs back inside. Huerta explained that keeping enrollment numbers around 6 people per program session, to maintain proper social distancing, has forced difficult decisions.</p>
                    <p>"The most difficult part of that is electing the five out of 20 that we know need the services, that we know need these distractions," Huerta said.</p>
                    <p>The organization has provided services for healthcare, food, education, legal help and mental health to Little Village residents since 2008, when the Little Village Community Development Corporation, founded in 1990, was renamed as Enlace Chicago.</p>
                    <p>La Villita is a predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood, with 77 percent of the population identifying as such, and about a quarter of the population are undocumented immigrants. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the neighborhood hard, by crippling their booming retail economy; Little Village ordinarily relies on restaurants, shops, bakeries and street vendors for residents' jobs, but the pandemic shut those down. Little Village is also facing high rates of illness alongside the rest of Cook County, which is nearing 300,000 positive COVID-19 cases with a test positivity rate near 16 percent.</p>
                    <p>Even with the challenges brought by the pandemic, Little Village continues to encounter issues of street violence that they have faced for years.</p>
                    <p>"Para ellos, nada cambi√≥. Ellos siempre han vivido en estado de crisis," Alicia Martinez, the violence prevention program manager at Enlace, said.</p>
                    <p>For Terrazas, who has been participating in programs with Enlace since he was 14 years old, the support Enlace provides is too essential to stop for the coronavirus. Without support from the violence prevention department, he wouldn't have been able to avoid the street violence that was a part of his life as a young teenager.</p>
                    <p>"I used to only go home to shower and then go back into the streets [...] If I would've never met them, then I would be totally different. By now, I'm pretty sure I would be in a gang," Terrazas said.</p>
                    <p>When he was shot last year, staff at Enlace helped him get to his doctor and rehabilitation appointments, treating him to a meal out after. Terrazas was aided in finding healthcare despite having no insurance and continued to participate in violence prevention programs offered by Enlace.</p>
                    <p>The violence prevention department, led by Martinez, a social worker who used to work with foster youth and families in Chicago, is centered around acknowledging and addressing mental health issues facing the neighborhood's youth. Martinez feels a responsibility to end the school-to-prison in Little Village, by discussing trauma and mental health, while encouraging schools to reduce punitive measures.</p>
                    <p>With a network of school-based counselors in four Little Village schools and street-based counselors around the neighborhood, Martinez's programs provide one-on-one counseling for youth alongside a mentorship program.</p>
                    <p>While school closures and social distancing have made meetings with on-campus counselors more difficult, some have gone out of their way to continue to connect with youth. Martinez said one counselor even shows up to McDonald's wearing personal protective equipment to make sure teens can stop by to talk safely.</p>
                    <p>Among these mentors is Little Village native Anthony Chappell, who works as a case manager for Enlace. Chappell got caught up in street violence as a teenager and ended up spending some time in jail before realizing he wanted to prevent others in La Villita from following the same path.</p>
                    <p>"They're good kids, they're just sometimes stuck in bad situations. They go through so much and in this community, they're forced to grow up too fast," Chappell said.</p>
                    <p>Chappell spends his days talking to youth on the phone, texting them, making video calls and meeting in person with masks to keep up with them, connecting teens with any services they need for education, healthcare, housing and job training. The pandemic hasn't deterred Chappell from his work, who plans to continue connecting with participants no matter what.</p>
