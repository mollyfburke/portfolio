                    <h2>Implementation of no-loan policy leads to changes in financial aid packages</h2>
                    <h3>By Molly Burke</h3>
                    <h3>Dec. 4, 2019</h3> 
                    <p>Jenn Beardsley made the decision to attend Northwestern University to get out of the poverty cycle.</p>
                    <p>With an annual cost of attendance totaling almost $79,000, this may not seem like the most logical decision. However, Beardsley, a freshman at SESP, was offered a generous financial aid package. In fact, the grants and scholarships she received were ultimately what pushed her to choose NU over a public school closer to her hometown of Roseville, California.</p>
                    <p>Beardsley and about 46% of NU students have benefitted from Northwestern's new no-loan policy, which reached its final implementation with the class of 2023. The policy guarantees that NU will provide grants and aid that will cover 100% of students' demonstrated financial need without loans. </p>
                    <p>Northwestern is not alone in adopting this policy. Other selective private schools with large endowments have done the same in an effort to attract more students from all income brackets.</p>
                    <p>The director of Northwestern's Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid, Phil Asbury, explained that the no-loan policy was discussed at NU when they felt a national push to make higher education more accessible to all.</p>
                    <p>The no-loan policy, which costs Northwestern an additional $25 million, makes up 10% of the annual spending on financial aid, a significant increase. </p>
                    <p>Professor Jesse Rothstein at University of California, Berkeley, and professor Cecilia E. Rouse at Princeton University conducted a study regarding the no-loan policy, following its implementation at an anonymous university. They found that while the policy brought in more minorities, it did not have a significant change on the wealth of the students matriculating.</p>
                    <p>A greater change was shown to occur in the careers that students pursued following graduation. Rather than feeling pressured to take on a high-paying job in the private sector to pay off debt, more graduates worked in public service jobs, like teaching.</p>
                    <p>The policy, while often unheard of by students, has faced some confusion when students receive their financial aid packages, as federal loans are still listed, though they are optional. Asbury explained that the loans are offered in addition to the grants, though the grants alone cover the demonstrated financial need. The loans are an optional, additional supplement.</p>
                    <p>Beardsley, for whom financial aid was a large component of her college decision, originally rejected the loans in her package, as she was wary of taking on debt. However, her family realized that the price of student health insurance at Northwestern (NU-SHIP) would be a factor, as Beardsley's current health insurance wouldn't cover her.</p>
                    <p>"We ended up having to take out a loan to cover health insurance because my health insurance expires the second I step out of my home state," Beardsley said.</p>
                    <p>Beardsley and her parents were extremely concerned with the long-term effect on their financial wellness when taking out the loans.</p>
                    <p>"My parents are very much like if you can't buy it in cash, don't buy it, don't touch it, don't look at it," Beardsley said.</p>
                    <p>She was also confused about why she had to take out a loan when she thought that NU was trying to cover the costs without loans.</p>
                    <p>Asbury explained that many students feel this way because what they view as their own financial need is higher than the demonstrated financial need according to the Free Application for Student Financial Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile.</p>
                    <p>Requiring the consultation of lengthy, complex tax forms, the FAFSA and CSS Profile often leave students feeling that their expected family contribution (EFC) is far higher than what their family can actually afford.</p>
                    <p>School of Communications junior Nolan Robinson was worried that this would be the case with him. His anxiety was only amplified by the fact that, when working on the forms with his mom and sister, they didn't understand the complicated tax language.</p>
                    <p>Coming from a low-income family with three siblings, Robinson knew that he would need a significant amount of money to make Northwestern a possibility.</p>
                    <p>"I was afraid that some wrong piece of information would show Northwestern that I don't need as much as I actually do. My anxiety was so high until I finally got the financial aid package," Robinson said.</p>
                    <p>He ended up with a package that covered all of tuition, housing and meals, even including a small stipend. However, Robinson still faces significant financial burdens with everyday expenses, from going out to eat to buying new clothes to getting textbooks every quarter.</p>
                    <p>"Whenever I plan classes for the following quarters, I'm very meticulous about it. What classes need books? How much are those books going to cost?" Robinson said.</p>
                    <p>With these concerns about other expenses in mind, Robinson knows that the loans offered to him in his financial aid package could help him out in the short-term and alleviate some of his stress, but he chooses not to take on debt for long-term benefits.</p>
                    <p>"I know I am going to have to pay it back. I don't like to worry about things. I just want to focus on school," Robinson said.</p>
                    <p>Weinberg freshman Clayton Miles was also offered a generous financial aid package but felt that he had no choice but to accept the loans offered to him. Miles is concerned that his debt, currently about $5,000, will continue to grow every year and add to academic stress.</p>
                    <p>As more elite private universities implement similar policies, the average loan balance among these students decreases significantly. </p>
                    <p>However, the policy certainly does not guarantee graduation without debt. Rouse explained that the varied methods by which schools determine your financial aid can play a large part in how much debt students take on.</p>
                    <p>For Miles, the discrepancy between what he was given and what he can afford is a stressor.</p>
                    <p>"It might just keep building. By taking out loans I feel pressure to study something or, when I leave, get a decent job so that I can actually pay it off," Miles said.</p>
